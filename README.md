## 🏗 AI Engineering

Core tools, frameworks, and practices for building production-grade AI systems — from RAG pipelines to evals, guardrails, and deployment. (Personal note: you don't need tons of frameworks. Start with simple LLM calls and work up from there).

- [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) — Open-source search/RAG framework with modular pipelines.

### Orchestration & Agents
- [Pydantic-AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) — Typed, structured LLM orchestration framework built on Pydantic models for safe, predictable outputs.
- [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) — Build multi-agent workflows with stateful graphs on top of LangChain.
- [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) — Agent orchestration with structured tasks and human-in-the-loop controls.
