This is a curated list of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, courses, books, lectures, and papers. AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and recognizing patterns. AI aims to mimic human cognitive functions, making machines capable of improving their performance based on experience, adapting to new inputs, and performing human-like tasks.
